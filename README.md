# 📊 Indian Demat & Stock Trading Analytics – Power BI Portfolio Project

Hi, I’m Sumit 👋  
This project is part of my **Business Intelligence portfolio** to showcase my ability to work with **realistic financial datasets, build BI dashboards, and deliver business insights**.  
I’m actively looking for **Business Intelligence / Data Analyst roles**, and this project demonstrates my **end-to-end BI skills**.

---

## 🗂️ Project Overview
I created a **synthetic dataset of 10,000 demat account holders in India** with attributes like:
- Customer demographics (age, gender, state, city, income type, business type)
- Financial details (net worth, annual income, portfolio value)
- Trading activity (primary stock, holdings, buy/sell dates & prices, number of trades)
- Risk profiles and active trader status  

The goal was to analyze **customer behavior, stock holdings, and trading activity** to extract business insights useful for a demat/trading company.

---

## 🎯 Problem Statements Solved
1. **Customer Demographics:**  
   Which states, cities, and income groups dominate the customer base?  

2. **Portfolio Analysis:**  
   What is the distribution of portfolio values, net worth, and most popular stocks?  

3. **Risk & Trading Activity:**  
   What % of customers are high-risk vs low-risk, and how active are traders?  

4. **Business Insights:**  
   Which customer segments (by business type/income type) bring maximum portfolio value?  

---

## 📌 KPIs Built in Power BI
- Total Customers  
- Active vs Inactive Traders (%)  
- Total Portfolio Value (Assets Under Management)  
- Average Portfolio Value per Customer  
- Total Stock Holdings (shares)  
- Unrealized Gains/Losses (₹)  
- % of Profitable Customers  
- Popular Stocks Held  
- Average Trades per Customer (last 12 months)  
- Demographic Distributions (Gender, Age, State, Business Type)  

---

## 📊 Dashboards
The Power BI report contains multiple dashboards:

1. **Customer Overview** – demographics, income, and risk segmentation  
2. **Portfolio Insights** – holdings, stock preferences, portfolio values  
3. **Trading Activity** – buy/sell trends, trades in last 12 months, active vs inactive users  
4. **Business Insights** – key value-driving customer segments
